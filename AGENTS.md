# Working rules

These rules apply to every agent working in this repository (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode).

- When reporting verification, say exactly what was proven and what was not.
- Project structure and how to run things: README.md.

## Delivery

- Work that is likely to end in a committed edit runs the full flow: invoke the
  `repo-task-delivery` skill and let it drive.
  The flow: issue on the board → branch from that issue → implement → verify → PR → owner review → merge → Done.
- Issues are filed by `bash .claude/skills/gh-project-workflow/scripts/start_issue_flow.sh`,
  never by hand: it puts the issue on the board with Status, Priority and Showcase and creates
  its branch. An issue that is not on the board does not exist.
- Priority is Urgent / High / Medium / Low. Judge it; never leave it empty.
- Branches come from `gh issue develop` (the start script), named `<number>-<slug>`.
  Never `git checkout -b` / `git switch -c`.
- Never push to `main`; it accepts pull requests only. Merge only when the owner says so
  (`merge_issue_flow.sh` and `gh pr merge` ask for confirmation).
- Not part of the flow: answering a question, reading or measuring, continuing an issue that is
  already active, or the owner saying to skip GitHub.
- A refusal from a hook or a permission rule stops the work and goes to the owner: what you
  were doing, what was refused, the refusal verbatim. Do not look for a way around it.
  If the owner asks for a blocked command outright, prefix it with `DELIVERY_GUARD=off`;
  never do that on your own judgement.

## Decisions

- A decision about what a person does or sees cannot be settled by the code. Name it before
  the first artifact and ask the owner in one line with two named options. Until answered, it
  is a line in the issue.
- A choice between alternatives that are expensive to reverse is recorded as an ADR in the
  same pull request (`adr` skill). Every PR body carries an `ADR:` line.
- New screen or visual redesign: invoke `frontend-design:frontend-design` before building it.

## Issues

- The repository is public. Never put secrets or the state of a live system (what is broken,
  what a password is not) into issues, PRs, commits or docs.
- An issue exists only for work a pull request can close, a bug, or a decision worth recording.
  Findings, measurements and notes are comments on the existing issue.
- Search open issues before filing. One issue may host several PRs.
- Dependencies use the native blocked-by relation. A chain deeper than A needs B needs C is
  planning disguised as tracking — merge the nodes.

## Commits

PRs merge by squash; these rules govern the branch history the reviewer reads.

- Subject: Conventional Commits with the issue in the scope — `feat(GH-12): add landing page`.
  Types: feat, fix, docs, refactor, test, perf, build, ci, chore.
- A branch carries as few commits as its changes need. Each is one self-contained change that
  builds and passes on its own.
- Unrelated changes never share a commit; one change is never split across several.
- No fixup, typo, WIP or "address review" commits survive to the merge: fold them with
  `git commit --fixup <sha>` + `GIT_SEQUENCE_EDITOR=: git rebase --autosquash main`.
- Rewritten history is pushed with `git push --force-with-lease`, only to your own issue branch.

## After the merge

- A merged issue is closed. Follow-up work is a new task, except obvious closeout caused by
  the merged change.

## Token hygiene

- `git diff --stat` before a full diff; then diff only the files you need. History: `git log --oneline -20`.
- Hand subagents file paths, not pasted contents.
- Long logs and CI output go to the `log-reader` agent; mechanical board/git chores to `ops`.

# This project

<!-- Everything below the dev-kit block belongs to this project and is never touched by kit init.
     Keep it short: what is special about working in this repository. Structure and commands
     belong in README.md. -->

- What it is and how to run it: README.md. A static page in `public/`, no build step.
- Deploying is the owner's step (`npx wrangler deploy` from their machine). Do not deploy
  unless the owner asks for it in this session.
- The site is public and its repository too. The only contact address that may appear on the
  site is the one on the site's own domain; never any other personal address. No "open to
  work" note until the owner says otherwise.
- The earlier multilingual version is parked on the `full-site` branch. It comes back one
  section per issue; do not merge that branch wholesale.
